🐾 Feed the Animals - Bonus Challenge Prototype
This project is part of a Unity Learn tutorial that includes optional bonus challenges for enhancing the "Feed the Animals" prototype. While these features are not required to complete the course, they provide a great opportunity to explore additional gameplay mechanics and polish.

✅ All four bonus challenges have been successfully implemented in this project.

🚀 Bonus Challenges Implemented
✅ Easy: Vertical Player Movement
Allows the player to move up and down in addition to left and right, adding more dynamic navigation to the game.

✅ Medium: Aggressive Animals
Some animals now behave aggressively, chasing or reacting to the player when approached.

✅ Hard: Game User Interface (UI)
A simple and effective UI system was added, including score display, health, or game status.

✅ Expert: Animal Hunger Bar
Each animal now has a visible hunger bar that decreases over time, requiring the player to feed them before it runs out.

🎮 How to Play
Use arrow keys or WASD to move the player.

Feed the animals before their hunger bars empty.

Avoid aggressive animals or handle them with strategy.

Monitor the game through the user interface.
